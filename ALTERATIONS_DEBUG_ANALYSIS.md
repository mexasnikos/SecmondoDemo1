# ProvideQuotationWithAlterations Debug Analysis

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Missing Method Implementation** ✅ FIXED
- The `ProvideQuotationWithAlterations` method was mentioned in comments but not implemented
- **Solution**: Added complete implementation in `terracottaService.ts`

### 2. **TypePolicyID Mismatch** ⚠️ LIKELY ISSUE
- Your AlterationIDs (39855, 39794) are for "Silver Single Trip" policy
- You're using `TypePolicyID=2` but the image suggests Silver Single Trip might need `TypePolicyID=1`
- **Solution**: Try `TypePolicyID=1` instead of `TypePolicyID=2`

### 3. **QuoteID Validity** ⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUE
- You're using `QuoteID=8547466` which might be invalid or expired
- **Solution**: First get a valid QuoteID using regular `ProvideQuotation`, then use it for alterations

### 4. **Request Structure** ✅ FIXED
- The SOAP structure was correct but missing proper implementation
- **Solution**: Added proper SOAP envelope building

## Corrected Request

### Original (Failing):
```xml
<TypePolicyID>2</TypePolicyID>
```

### Corrected:
```xml
<TypePolicyID>1</TypePolicyID>
```

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test with Corrected TypePolicyID
Use the corrected XML in `test-corrected-alterations.xml`:
- Changed `TypePolicyID` from `2` to `1`
- This matches the "Silver Single Trip" policy type for your AlterationIDs

### Step 2: Get Valid QuoteID First
1. Run regular `ProvideQuotation` to get a valid QuoteID
2. Use that QuoteID in `ProvideQuotationWithAlterations`

### Step 3: Test Individual AlterationIDs
Try each AlterationID separately:
- `39855` (ADDITIONAL PERSONAL ACCIDENT COVER TOP-UP)
- `39794` (Excess Waiver Option)

## Implementation Added

### New Interface:
```typescript
export interface TerracottaQuoteWithAlterationsRequest {
  userID: string;
  userCode: string;
  QuoteID: string;
  AlterationID: string; // Comma-separated list
  quoteDetails: TerracottaQuoteDetails;
}
```

### New Method:
```typescript
async provideQuotationWithAlterations(request: TerracottaQuoteWithAlterationsRequest): Promise<TerracottaQuoteResponse>
```

## Debug Script

Run `test-alterations-debug.js` to test multiple scenarios:
1. Your exact request
2. With TypePolicyID=1
3. With single AlterationID
4. Get valid QuoteID first
5. Use valid QuoteID with alterations

## Expected Results

If the issue is TypePolicyID mismatch, you should get quotes when using `TypePolicyID=1`.

If the issue is QuoteID validity, you should get quotes after using a fresh QuoteID from `ProvideQuotation`.

## Next Steps

1. Test the corrected XML request
2. Run the debug script
3. Check the SOAP audit logs for detailed error information
4. Verify the AlterationIDs are valid for the policy type
