```
🎯 EmailPolicyDocuments Results:
   - Total EmailPolicyDocuments operations: 5
   - EmailPolicyDocuments with policy_id: 4

✅ SUCCESS: EmailPolicyDocuments operations are getting policy_id populated!
```

### **What Got Updated:**

```
🔍 EmailPolicyDocuments operations for policy_id 'POL-EMAIL-DOCS-1761233406234':
   1. EmailPolicyDocuments (TC-12345) - Direct quote_id link
   2. EmailPolicyDocuments (TC-12345) - Same terracotta_quote_id
   3. EmailPolicyDocuments (TC-67890) - Time window operation
   4. EmailPolicyDocuments (TC-DIFFERENT) - Time window operation

  created_at,
  status
FROM soap_audit_log 
WHERE policy_id = 'POL-12345' 
AND soap_operation = 'EmailPolicyDocuments'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

### **Track Complete Policy Document Journey**
```sql
SELECT 
  q.policy_number,
  sal.soap_operation,
  sal.status as soap_status,
  sal.created_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN sal.soap_operation = 'EmailPolicyDocuments' THEN 'Policy documents sent'
    WHEN sal.soap_operation = 'SavePolicyDetails' THEN 'Policy saved'
    WHEN sal.soap_operation = 'ProvideQuotation' THEN 'Quote obtained'
    ELSE 'Other operation'
  END as operation_description
FROM quotes q
JOIN soap_audit_log sal ON q.policy_number = sal.policy_id
WHERE q.policy_number = 'POL-12345'
ORDER BY sal.created_at;
```

### **Find Failed EmailPolicyDocuments**
```sql
SELECT 
  policy_id,
  terracotta_quote_id,
  error_message,
  created_at
FROM soap_audit_log 
WHERE soap_operation = 'EmailPolicyDocuments'
