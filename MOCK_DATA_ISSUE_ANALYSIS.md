# Mock Data Issue Analysis

## Problem Identified

You're still seeing mock data because the **SOAP requests are failing due to XML parsing issues**, causing the app to fall back to mock data.

## Root Cause

### ‚ùå **XML Parsing Issue**
1. **Node.js Environment**: `DOMParser` is not available
2. **Browser Environment**: `DOMParser` works but xmldom fallback fails
3. **Result**: SOAP requests fail ‚Üí App falls back to mock data

### üîç **Evidence**
- SOAP requests are **working** (200 OK responses)
- Policy type names are **correct** in SOAP response:
  - "Single Trip" (TypePolicyID: 2)
  - "Annual Multi-Trip" (TypePolicyID: 23)
  - "Longstay" (TypePolicyID: 3)
- But **XML parsing fails** ‚Üí Mock data is shown

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
1. **SOAP Requests**: All SOAP calls are successful
2. **Real Data**: Terracotta returns correct policy type names
3. **UI Integration**: Code is set up to use SOAP data

### ‚ùå **What's Failing:**
1. **XML Parsing**: `DOMParser` issues in both Node.js and browser
2. **Fallback Logic**: When SOAP fails, app shows mock data
3. **User Experience**: You see mock data instead of real SOAP data

## Solution

### **Option 1: Fix XML Parsing (Recommended)**
The XML parsing needs to be fixed to work in both environments:

```typescript
// Current issue: DOMParser not working properly
const parser = new DOMParser(); // ‚ùå Fails in Node.js
const xmlDoc = parser.parseFromString(xmlText, 'text/xml');

// Need: Robust XML parsing that works everywhere
const parser = await this.getXMLParser(); // ‚úÖ Should work
```

### **Option 2: Test in Browser**
The SOAP integration should work in the browser environment. Test by:
1. Opening your React app in browser
2. Going to quote page
3. Checking if real policy type names appear

### **Option 3: Verify SOAP Integration**
Check if the SOAP requests are actually being made in your app:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Navigate to quote page
4. Look for SOAP requests to Terracotta

## Expected Behavior

### **When Working Correctly:**
- **Trip Type Dropdown**: Shows "Single Trip", "Annual Multi-Trip", "Longstay"
- **Quote Results**: Shows real quotes from Terracotta
- **No Mock Data**: All data comes from SOAP responses

### **Current Behavior:**
- **Trip Type Dropdown**: Shows fallback options or mock data
- **Quote Results**: Shows mock quotes
- **Mock Data**: App falls back to hardcoded data

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Browser**: Open your React app and check if SOAP data appears
2. **Fix XML Parsing**: Resolve the DOMParser issues
3. **Verify Network**: Check if SOAP requests are being made
4. **Debug Console**: Look for SOAP-related errors in browser console

## Files to Check

- `src/pages/Quote2.tsx` - Main quote page
- `src/services/terracottaService.ts` - SOAP service
- Browser Network tab - SOAP requests
- Browser Console - Error messages

The SOAP integration is **technically working** but the **XML parsing is failing**, causing the fallback to mock data.
