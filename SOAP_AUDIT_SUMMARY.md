## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Create Database Table
```bash
cd backend
node setup-soap-audit.js
```

### Step 2: Start Proxy Server
```bash
cd server
node proxy-server.js
```

### Step 3: Open Dashboard
Open `backend/soap-monitor-dashboard.html` in your browser

**That's it!** All SOAP requests are now being logged automatically.

---

## 📊 What Gets Tracked

Every SOAP request automatically captures:

```
✅ Complete request and response XML
✅ Operation type (ProvideQuotation, SavePolicyDetails, etc.)
✅ HTTP status codes and headers
✅ Response time in milliseconds
✅ Success/failure status
✅ Error messages
✅ Terracotta Quote IDs and Policy IDs
✅ Timestamp and client information
```

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Monitor Quote Completeness
```sql
-- Check if a quote has all required SOAP operations
SELECT * FROM check_quote_soap_completeness(123);
```

**Result:**
```
has_provide_quotation: true
has_save_policy_details: true
all_operations_successful: true
operation_summary: "ProvideQuotation:success, SavePolicyDetails:success"
```

### 2. Find Failed Requests
```sql
-- Get all failed SOAP operations
SELECT * FROM recent_soap_errors;
```

### 3. Track Performance
```sql
-- Get average response time by operation
SELECT * FROM soap_request_summary;
```

### 4. Debugging
```bash
# Get all SOAP operations for a specific quote
curl http://localhost:3001/api/soap-logs/quote/123
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

The proxy server (port 3001) provides these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/soap-logs` | Get all logs with filtering |
| `GET /api/soap-logs/summary` | Get statistics by operation |
| `GET /api/soap-logs/errors` | Get recent errors |
| `GET /api/soap-logs/quote/:id` | Get operations for a quote |
| `GET /api/soap-logs/quote/:id/completeness` | Check quote completeness |

---

## 💾 Database Schema

### Main Table: `soap_audit_log`

Key columns:
- `quote_id` - Links to your quotes table
- `soap_operation` - e.g., 'ProvideQuotation'
- `request_body` - Complete SOAP XML request
- `response_body` - Complete SOAP XML response
- `terracotta_quote_id` - Quote ID from Terracotta
- `terracotta_policy_id` - Policy ID from Terracotta
- `status` - 'success', 'failed', 'error', 'pending'
- `response_time_ms` - Performance metric
- `error_message` - Error details if failed

### Views

1. **`soap_request_summary`** - Stats by operation
2. **`quote_soap_history`** - All operations per quote
3. **`recent_soap_errors`** - Last 100 errors
4. **`soap_performance_by_hour`** - Hourly metrics

---

## 🎨 Monitoring Dashboard

The HTML dashboard (`soap-monitor-dashboard.html`) shows:

**Real-time Statistics:**
- Total requests
- Success rate percentage
- Failed requests count
- Average response time

**Tables:**
- Summary by operation (ProvideQuotation, SavePolicyDetails, etc.)
- Recent errors with details
- Recent SOAP requests with filtering

**Features:**
- Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- Filter by operation type
- Color-coded status badges
- Response time highlighting (fast/medium/slow)

✅ **Automatic logging** - no code changes needed in your app  
✅ **Quote tracking** - see which quotes have proper SOAP interactions  
✅ **Operation monitoring** - track ProvideQuotation, SavePolicyDetails, etc.  
✅ **Completeness checking** - verify quotes have all required operations  
✅ **Error tracking** - identify and debug failed requests  
✅ **Performance monitoring** - track response times  
✅ **Easy querying** - SQL functions and REST API

## 🎯 Example Workflow

### Scenario: Quote #123 fails to save policy

**1. Check SOAP history:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_quote_soap_operations(123);
```

**2. Check completeness:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM check_quote_soap_completeness(123);
```

**Result:**
```
has_provide_quotation: true
has_save_policy_details: false  ❌
all_operations_successful: false
operation_summary: "ProvideQuotation:success, SavePolicyDetails:failed"
```

**3. Get error details:**
```sql
SELECT error_message, request_body, response_body
FROM soap_audit_log
WHERE quote_id = 123 AND soap_operation = 'SavePolicyDetails';
```

**4. Debug using the actual request/response XML!**
